# SendSeparately

Known issue - If I filter com.apple.chatkit, it should show up in the Share Sheet as well (since CKShareSheetChatController inherits from CKComposeChatController), however only the UISwitch appears and it looks terrible.

If anyone knows why that happens, please fork and let me know!
